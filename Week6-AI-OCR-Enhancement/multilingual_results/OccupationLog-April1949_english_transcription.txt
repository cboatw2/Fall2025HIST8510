Occupational
ACTIVITIES

Sister-City Invitation—In the interest 
of international good will and under- 
standing, the English seaport town of 
Hull has offered the German seaport 
town of Bremen an opportunity to 
exchange public officials of the re- 
spective cities, whose economic 
development has followed similar 
lines. The special offer from Hull in- 
vites the German officials of Bremen 
to occupy desks as observers of their 
democratic administration in England 
and suggests that Bremen make avail- 
able the same opportunity to Hull 
observers.

Rhein-Main Reopened—Civil air lines 
temporarily forced to use the Stutt- 
gart-Echterdingen airport because of 
expansion of the Berlin airlift last 
fall have been authorized to return 
to Rhein-Main Near Frankfurt. Four- 
teen additional flights from their old 
base will bring the number of civil 
airline flights daily to 20. The ad- 
ditional traffic has been made possible 
because of improved weather and the 
success of the airlift.

Army Medical Center—A US Army 
Medical Center with an eventual 
capacity of 1,250 beds for EUCOM 
military and civilian personnel will 
soon be established in Munich. Built 
on the grounds of the present 
98th General Hospital, the medical 
center will provide all specialized 
medical and surgical care except for 
tuberculosis and gynecology, which 
will remain at the 97th General Hos- 
pital in Frankfurt.

False Teeth Contraband: A new 
item was found in interzonal smugg- 
ing traffic. False teeth were seized by 
Hessian border police in the town of 
Philippsthal near Soviet Zone border. 
The illegal shipment, destined for 
consumption in the Soviet Zone, con- 
tained 4,048 artificial molars, 7,018 
artificial incisors, 18 packets of dental 
powder and other dental supplies.

Stronger Beer: German brewers 
were authorized to increase the 
strength of beer for domestic con- 
sumption from 5.5 to 8 percent, sub- 
ject to approval by the respective 
states, BICO announced. This move 
was made possible by the release of 
50,000 tons of barley for beer pro- 
duction following collection of the 
full grain quota of 1,750,000 tons 
for human consumption.

Visitors to Use D-Marks—Foreign 
visitors will pay their expenses in 
western Germany with Deutsche- 
marks beginning in May, JEIA an- 
nounced. The new arrangement will 
discontinue use of devision coupons 
used to pay for accommodations and 
meals in JEIA-licensed hotels and 
eliminate the licensing by JEIA of 
any more hotels or restaurants in 
western Germany.

Occupation Births—3,278 babies were 
born in US Army hospitals in the 
American occupied areas during 1948, 
EUCOM Hq. announced. The maternal 
death rate during that period was 
only one-third that for the United 
States in the last year for which 
official statistics are available. In- 
fant mortality statistics were not 
given.

Fishing Fleet Expansion—Sixteen US- 
owned fishing trawlers to aid in 
supplying food for the German eco- 
nomy are being purchased by the 
Office of Food Administration for Oc- 
cupied Areas in behalf of the US 
Government, OMG Bremen announced. 
The trawlers, many of which are prac- 
tically new, will be manned by Ger- 
man fishermen after refitting of the ves- 
sels by the New York Port of Embark- 
ation.

Welfare Activities—1,287 dairy cattle, 
a gift of the Brethren's Commission, 
an American religious organization, 
will be distributed to refugee families, 
religious organizations, research and 
veterinary colleges in the eight west- 
German states. In order that the wel- 
fare plan will be a continuing one, it 
has been stipulated that the first 
heifer calf born by each cow will be 
given free to another needy family 
or organization.

Food Outlook Encouraging—The fat 
ration for normal German consumers 
during March was increased to 750 
grams (1 lb. 10.3 oz.) and the meat 
ration to 500 grams (1 lb.1.5 oz.). The 
ration increase, according to Mr. 
Stanley Andrews, BICO food chief, 
are largely due to stepped-up food 
collections and a decline in the price 
of fat.

Airlift Support Organized—The US 
Army Airlift Support Command, com- 
prising all elements of the US Army 
in Europe which are working in 
direct support of "Vittles" operations 
was created effective April 1. Com- 
manding general of the new command 
is Brig. Gen. Philip E. Gallagher.

Young Lawyers Aided—To aid in a 
training and reorientation program 
for young Hessian lawyers, DM 14,500 
($4,350) have been contributed to the 
Hessian Ministry of Justice from the 
OMG Hessen Reorientation Fund. Under 
the program 35-40 young lawyers 
will attend one-week conferences dur- 
ing the next four months.

US Newspaper for German Labor—
Sale in the Bizone of the US-printed 
German language labor newspaper 
Neue Volkszeitung (New People's 
Newspaper) has been authorized by 
the ECA under terms of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1948. A guaranty 
contract between the ECA and the 
Progressive Publishing Association, 
New York City, will permit the 
publisher to invest dollars in the Bi- 
zone and convert its Deutsche-mark 
receipts into dollars up to the amount 
of dollar expenses incurred.
